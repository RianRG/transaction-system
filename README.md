# Transaction System

A fullstack api that uses NestJs (Node framework) in backend and Angular (Javascript framework) on front-end.

## Description

This project is a transaction system developed with NestJS on the backend and Angular on the frontend. The system uses JWT cookies for login.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and secure way to manage transactions. The system is designed to be easy to use and scalable.

## Features

Account creation: Users can create accounts with a username, password, and email address.
Login: Users can login with their username and password.
Transaction creation: Users can create new transactions (only one transaction per email).

## Technical details

Backend: The backend is implemented using NestJS, a framework for building scalable and efficient Node.js applications.

---
Frontend: The frontend is implemented using Angular, a framework for building web applications.

Database: The system uses a SQLite database to store data. 
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained SQL database engine. It is commonly used in mobile and desktop applications to store and manage data locally. SQLite is known for its small size, ease of integration, and high performance. It supports standard SQL queries and transactions, making it a versatile choice for developers.
